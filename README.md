# Course Explorer Block

## Name
block_mat_explorer

## Description
This is a block plugin to display and manage courses in Moodle 4+. Features of this plugin are extended filter and sorting options,
informative course tiles, pre-filtering by course categories and 2 different views: "all courses" and "my courses".
While pre-filtering and views can be set up in a block's configuration (Turn moodle edit mode on ->
click on cog wheel icon of the block -> select configuration), dropdown filters, sorting and information displayed on
tiles are fixed and require code amendments in order to adjust them.

There is an option to apply MINTCampus style preset to a plugin's view. In plugin settings 
(Site administration -> Plugins -> Course Explorer) there is a checkbox allowing to load a MINTCampus CSS-file.
